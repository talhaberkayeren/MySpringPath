# MySpringPath ☕🌱

Welcome to my Spring learning journey!

This repository is a collection of mini-projects and exercises I built while learning **Java Spring Framework** — from my very first REST API to more advanced features I'll explore along the way.

## 📂 Project Structure

Each folder represents a standalone project:
- `01-hello-rest-api` – A simple REST API returning a greeting message

## 📚 Purpose

I'm currently learning Spring step by step. This repo is both a notebook and a showcase of what I’ve practiced so far.

More updates coming as I learn more! 🚀
